## COE3DQ5 project


### Objective

The objective for this project was to implement a custom image decompression
specification in hardware. The custom digital circuit created in this project takes compressed
data and converts it back into the original image, which is then displayed onto a monitor. To
complete this we broke the project down into 3 separate steps/milestones.


### Milestones

The first step of this process would have been done in milestone 3, where we would
have taken the compressed image and decoded the bitstream into blocks of data. This data
would then be dequantized into a transformed image. In milestone 2 we then transformed the
image from the spatial domain into the frequency domain to recover the downsampled image.
Finally in milestone 1 we used colorspace conversion and interpolation to turn the
downsampled image back into its RGB form to be displayed on a monitor.
